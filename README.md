# Dress Searcher Project
Java Technical test

This is a multi-module Maven project with two modules. The Dress Searcher Service, a small 
RESTful webservice for finding dresses with price reductions. The Dress Searcher Client, a simple 
application which uses the REST API.

I am using the Spring Boot Framework with Java 11.
